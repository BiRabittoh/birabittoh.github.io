Italian, born in 1998, programming since 2016. I enjoy art in every form. 

_BiRabittoh_ comes from the Japanese pronunciation of "B-Rabbit", as said in Pandora Hearts, which was the first anime I ever watched on the internet.

I mostly like singleplayer games, although I have spent a good chunk of my life on [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/) and [Dead by Daylight](https://deadbydaylight.com/).

Rhythm games and JRPGs are my cup of tea, but I also like collect-a-thon platformers and any kind of experimental indie game. I'm also in love with Nintendo games: I have played and loved every mainline Mario and Zelda title.

My favorite games of all time, in no particular order, are [MOTHER 3](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/n08/a3uj/index.html), [Dragon Quest V](https://www.jp.square-enix.com/dqsp/dq5/en/) and [Outer Wilds](https://www.mobiusdigitalgames.com/outer-wilds.html).

As far as music goes, I only listen to a few authors. My favorites are Tally Hall, Tame Impala and early Twenty One Pilots.

I don't watch a lot of movies and TV shows, sadly. Breaking Bad definitely kept me hooked, but I didn't watch Better Call Saul yet.

A guilty pleasure of mine is anime that doesn't take itself too seriously: I absolutely loved JoJo's Bizarre Adventures and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, as well as One Punch Man (S1).
